## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This was a challenging project for me, but it was also a lot of fun. I struggled with getting the layout right, and while I don't think my approach was ideal, I managed to create a design that I'm happy with.

- Looking at my code now, I realize that it's messy and needs some work. I followed a tutorial by Kevin Powell (he was working on another project) and tried to incorporate his overall approach to the project (using variables and utility classes and so on..), but I felt overwhelmed and just wanted to make the project work. As a result, there are a lot of unnecessary things in my CSS, but I plan to refactor it later.

- As I typically do, I started this project with a mobile-first design approach. However, because the layout was more complex than my previous projects, I encountered some difficulties in overwriting the mobile max-width with media queries. It took some time to find a solution.

- I need to better organize my code and make it more DRY, but I'll save that for later. 

- Currently, my solution is smaller in height than the design, and it's not centered on the page. I believe adding a container that encompasses the body and main elements and centering that container will fix this issue.

### Continued development

In the future i plan to play a little bit more with the responsiveness and refactor the code.
